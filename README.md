# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects in this course had specific problems that needed to be solved. The scenario was that "ABC University (ABCU) was looking for software that will help their computer science advisors access course information for students". I was  required to demonstrate my ability to write plan and write a program that could import data from a file and store it in an appropriate data structure.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by planning and taking the neccessary steps to ensure success. I wrote a design document, which included psuedocode for the program as well as runtime analysis for each data strucuture that could possibly be used to store the data.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame any roadblocks that I encountered by reaching out to my professor, reading documentation and debugging code. Deciding which data strucutre to use would have been difficult because I did not fully comprehent the runtime differences between them. I overcame this by making a design document which gave me a clear understanding of the time and space complexities of each data structure, thus helping me make an informed decision on which data structure to use.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on these projects have expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by reminding me that planning is just as important as execution. in order to write a program that will last a long time successfully requires you to understand everything there is about the program, its requirements, design flow, and structure.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on these projects have evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The projects have helped me achieve this by further solidifying best practice principles when it comes to planning and writing code such as, object oriented programming.
